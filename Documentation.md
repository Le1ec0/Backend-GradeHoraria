# Context
This code defines a class called "ApplicationDbContext" which is a subclass of "DbContext" from the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore namespace. It creates an instance of this class with options passed in as a parameter to its constructor. This class is responsible for interacting with a database and it is used to perform CRUD operations.

It has three DbSets, one for each of the models "Curso", "Periodo" and "Materia", which are used to represent the data in the corresponding tables in the database.

The OnModelCreating method is used to set up relationships between the tables in the database. This method is called when the model is being created.

In this method, the relationships between the three models are defined, with the use of several method calls on the "modelBuilder" object.

The first call:
modelBuilder.Entity<Curso>().HasMany(c => c.Periodos).WithOne(p => p.Cursos).HasForeignKey(p => p.CursoId).OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.NoAction);

This call is defining the relationship between the Curso and Periodo models, where one Curso can have multiple Periodos and one Periodo belongs to one Curso. The HasForeignKey(p => p.CursoId) call sets the foreign key on the Periodo table, and OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.NoAction) specifies that when a Curso is deleted, the associated Periodos will not be deleted.

The next three calls are similar, but they are defining the relationships between the Periodo and Materia models, and between the Materia and Curso models.

Finally, this class is responsible for providing the context for the Entity Framework to interact with the database. The DbSets properties allow you to query the database and the OnModelCreating method allows you to configure the relationships between the tables in the database.

# Controllers
The CursoController class is a controller in an ASP.NET Core web application that is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to the "Curso" (course in Portuguese) resource. It is decorated with the [ApiController] attribute and has routes defined with the [Route("api/[controller]")] attribute, which specifies that the routes for this controller will be prefixed with "api/Curso".

The class has several methods, each of which handle a specific type of HTTP request:

The Get() method handles HTTP GET requests to the "/Cursos/GetAllCursos" route and retrieves a list of all courses from the database using the ApplicationDbContext, and returns them to the client in the response body.

The GetById(int id) method handles HTTP GET requests to the "/Cursos/GetCursoById/{id}" route and retrieves a specific course by its id from the database using the ApplicationDbContext, and returns it to the client in the response body.

The Post([FromBody] CursosRequestModel request) method handles HTTP POST requests to the "/Cursos/PostCursos" route and creates a new course in the database using the data from the request body and the ApplicationDbContext.

The Put(int id, [FromBody] CursosRequestModel cursosRequestModel) method handles HTTP PUT requests to the "/Cursos/PutCursoById/{id}" route and updates an existing course in the database by its id with the data from the request body using the IGradeRepository and the ApplicationDbContext.

The Delete([FromBody] int id) method handles HTTP DELETE requests to the "/Cursos/DeleteCursoById/{id}" route and deletes an existing course in the database by its id using the IGradeRepository and the ApplicationDbContext.

The class also has several private fields, including a readonly RoleManager<IdentityRole> roleManager, IConfiguration _configuration, IGradeRepository _repository and ApplicationDbContext _context.

The same is happening to the MateriasController.

# Models
The Curso class represents a course, with properties for the course's ID, name, turn, professor, and period. It also has two collections for Periodos and Materias, which are related to the course.

The CursoRequestModel class is a request model for a course, with properties for the course's name, turn, professor, and period. It is probably used as a data transfer object when creating or updating a course.

The Materia class represents a subject, with properties for the subject's ID, name, day of the week, room, professor, CursoId and PeriodoId. It also has two properties, Cursos and Periodos, that are related to the subject.

The MateriaRequestModel class is a request model for a subject, with properties for the subject's name, day of the week, professor, room, CursoId and PeriodoId. It is probably used as a data transfer object when creating or updating a subject.

The Periodo class represents a period, with properties for the period's ID, PeriodoId and CursoId. It also has a collection for Materias, which are related to the period.

The Response class is a simple class that represents a response, with properties for the response's status and message.

The UserRoles class is a static class that contains constants for various user roles, such as "Admin", "Coordenador", "Professor", and "Usuario". These constants are probably used to assign roles to users in the application.

# Repositories
The GradeRepository class is an implementation of the IGradeRepository interface. It uses the ApplicationDbContext class to interact with a database using Entity Framework Core, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for .NET.

The IGradeRepository interface defines a set of methods that allow to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on Curso and Materia objects. The GradeRepository class implements these methods by using the ApplicationDbContext to perform the corresponding operations on the database.

The GetCurso() and GetMateria() methods return an enumerable collection of Curso and Materia objects respectively. The GetCurso(int id) and GetMateria(int id) methods return a single Curso or Materia object based on the given id.

The AddCurso(Curso cursos) and AddMateria(Materia materias) methods add a new Curso and Materia objects to the database respectively. The UpdateCurso(Curso cursos) and UpdateMateria(Materia materias) methods update the existing Curso and Materia objects in the database respectively.

The DeleteCurso(Curso cursos) and DeleteMateria(Materia materias) methods delete the Curso and Materia objects from the database respectively.

The SaveChangesAsync() method saves the changes made to the database and returns a boolean value indicating whether the changes were saved successfully or not.

# Startup and Program
The Startup class in this code is responsible for configuring the services and middleware for an ASP.NET Core web application. The class has two main methods: ConfigureServices and Configure.

In the ConfigureServices method, the following services are added to the application:

Controllers with Newtonsoft JSON serialization options
CORS policy allowing all origins, methods, and headers
HTTP context accessor
OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation with Bearer token authentication
Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server connection and retry options
Azure Active Directory authentication with JWT Bearer authentication
Scoped services for RoleManager of IdentityRole and an implementation of IGradeRepository
In the Configure method, the following middleware is added to the application pipeline:

Development exception page and Swagger UI if in development environment
HSTS if not in development environment
Routing, HTTPS redirection, CORS policy, authorization, authentication, and endpoint mapping for controllers.

The Program class is responsible for the startup of the web host and configures the web host to use the Startup class. The Main method creates a new web host and runs it by calling Build() and Run() in sequence. The CreateWebHostBuilder method sets up the default configuration for the web host and specifies that the Startup class should be used for the startup configuration.

# .csproj
The .csproj file contains information about the project and its dependencies. It specifies the target framework, which in this case is .NET 7.0, as well as a number of package references. These package references include libraries such as Entity Framework, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity, and others. These libraries are used to add functionality to the application, such as working with databases and handling authentication. The IncludeAssets and PrivateAssets elements specify which assets should be included when the package is used by other projects, and which should be kept private to the current project.

# appsettings.json
The appsettings.json file is a configuration file for your ASP.NET Core application. It contains various settings such as connection strings, logging levels, and allowed hosts.

In this case, the file includes a "ConnectionStrings" section with a single connection string named "SQLConnection" that is used to connect to a SQL Server database named "GradeHoraria" using the "Trusted_Connection" method.

The "Logging" section defines the default log level as "Information" and sets the log level for Microsoft.AspNetCore to "Warning".

The "AllowedHosts" value is set to "*" which means that any host can access the application.

The "AzureAD" section contains settings for Azure Active Directory authentication. It includes the tenant ID, client ID, client secret, and callback paths for signing in and signing out.

# Some potential issues
The "SQLConnection" in the appsettings.json file is using a trusted connection and a hardcoded server name, which could be a security vulnerability if the application is deployed to a production environment.
The "ClientSecret" in the appsettings.json file appears to be hardcoded, which is a security vulnerability as it could be easily compromised by an attacker.
The "ClientId" and "TenantId" in the appsettings.json file are both set to "common", which could indicate that this is a placeholder value and may not be properly configured for the intended environment.
The use of the "Trust Server Certificate=true" in the SQLConnection string is not recommended as it could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks
The "AllowedHosts" is set to "*", which could allow any host to connect to the application, which could be a security vulnerability.
The appsettings.json file also seems to be missing a few important settings like the JWT token signing secret key, which could allow for token forgery and impersonation attacks.
The version of Entity Framework used is 6.4.4 which is old and may have security vulnerabilities.
The version of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer is 7.0.2 which is lower than the current version and there could be some vulnerabilities in it.
